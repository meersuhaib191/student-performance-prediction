# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project uses **Python** and **scikit-learn** to build a **regression model** that predicts students’ academic performance based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, and previous scores.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of student performance and train a machine learning model to predict the **final or average score** of a student.

This project demonstrates:
- Data loading and cleaning using **pandas**
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **seaborn** and **matplotlib**
- Model training and evaluation using **scikit-learn**
- Model persistence with **joblib**
- Integration with **GitHub** using Google Colab

## 🧩 Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle – *Student Performance Dataset*
- **File used:** `StudentPerformance.csv`
- **Attributes example:**
  - `gender`
  - `race/ethnicity`
  - `parental level of education`
  - `lunch`
  - `test preparation course`
  - `math score`
  - `reading score`
  - `writing score`

We predict the **average student score** from the input features.
